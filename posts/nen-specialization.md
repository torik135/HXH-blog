excerpt: "Specialization (特とく質しつ系けい, Tokushitsu-kei; abbrev. as 特) could be broadly defined as anything that does not belong in any of the other five categories, making it the vaguest Nen type."

## Specialization

It is currently unknown how Specialists develop their Nen abilities. In Neon's case, she obtained an ability that she had been wishing for since she was a child, while Tserriednich manifested his own one week after being initiated to Nen and without trying or even being aware of it. It seems that a Specialist's manifestation of Hatsu during Water Divination reflects their character and may thus give some insight into the general direction in which they might or should develop their ability, since Hatsu is profoundly affected by personality, although the information received this way is vague enough that it is impossible to pin down just what kind of ability a Specialist has already developed through their results during the Water Divination test.

Of the many possible effects that can occur during a Specialist's Water Divination, only three have been shown so far: Neferpitou's aura caused the leaf on top of the water to dry out and crumble; Tserriednich's caused the water to boil and a putrid smell to be released; and Kurapika's caused the water to change colors and the leaf to spin.
