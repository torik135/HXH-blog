## Emission

Due to its properties, Emission is typically employed in abilities with an emphasis on range and/or those that have long-lasting effects. Basic applications include shooting out projectiles or beams of aura at high speed. While this method is primarily used to attack, it can also be used to propel oneself or to cast an effect pertaining to another Nen type remotely. Advanced applications of this Nen category include teleportation and enabling one's aura to phase through non-living matter. Emission has also been combined with music to achieve surprising effects, such as relieving fatigue and transfixing the listeners.

Aura usually decreases in intensity very quickly when it leaves the source body, but adept Emitters can separate their aura from their body for long periods of time, over long distances, and still be able to maintain it and its functions.

Emitted aura appears to cap the user's output, and the more aura is separated from the user's body, the shorter the distance it can travel from the user. In some cases, users have shown the ability to recover emitted aura; thus far, this has only occurred when Manipulation was also involved.
