## Transmutation

Transmuters are not limited to mimicking the properties of solid matter. For example, Killua Zoldyck uses his aura to mimic the properties of electricity. Transmuters can also give their aura certain properties instead of replicating the characteristics of a substance in their entirety: Hisoka's Bungee Gum mimics and combines the properties of rubber and gum, and it is several times more flexible, sticky and durable than the real thing.

Altering the shape of one's aura falls in this Nen category too. Similar to Emission, constructs created via Transmutation are pure aura, therefore they are invisible to individuals incapable of using Nen. Transmutation is often mistaken for Conjuration due to their similarities. The difference is that Transmutation allows the user to mimic the properties of a substance with their aura, whereas Conjuration changes aura into the actual substance.
