excerpt: "Conjuration (具ぐ現げん化か系けい, Gugenka-kei; abbrev. as 具) is intended as the ability to create a physical, independent, material object out of one's aura; however, users of this category can also create laws and principles and affix them to a specific area"

## Conjuration

Constructs created via Conjuration have a subtle "independence" to them: under certain circumstances, they can continue existing even at a considerable distance from the Conjurer, or even if the Conjurer themselves are not aware that they have yet to be de-materialized. Some Conjurers have also exhibited the capacity to alter the length and size of a materialized item. Once a person has mastered the materialization of a certain object, they can conjure it and dispel it in an instant, whenever they want. However, even if one were to completely master this Nen type, there would still be objects they could not materialize, such as swords that can cut anything, as they go beyond "human capacity". Izunavi vaguely described this principle as the inability to conjure objects overly supernatural.

Users of this category can also create laws and principles and affix them to a specific area. The durability of a conjured object can generally be taken as a measure of the user's skill, although conditions can be used to strengthen it.

Conjured objects can, in fact, possess special abilities. For instance, the Phantom Troupe thief, Shizuku, is able to conjure a vacuum cleaner that can infinitely suck up objects, but with the condition that it cannot suck up living things and things made out of Nen. Similar to Manipulation, Conjuration abilities tend to be very specific, complex, and conditional. Conditions can be imbued into conjured objects to make them stronger. Kortopi, for example, is able to materialize a perfect inanimate copy of any object or person that he touches. However, the copies of all objects generated will automatically disappear after 24 hours.[ By resorting to Limitations, a Conjurer can take their ability a step further and materialize objects with properties that come even closer to exceeding human capacity, although they still cannot surpass it.

Conjuration is the only way in which Nen can create things that non-users can see and touch, unless they are hidden from the senses with In. Alternatively, Conjurers can create abilities whose constructs are invisible to non-users and even specific Nen users, to the point that only one person may be able to perceive them. However, the fewer people are able to see a conjured construct, the lower the risk and the more energy is expended in its creation, resulting in an increased aura cost.
