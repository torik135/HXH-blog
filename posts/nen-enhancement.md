## Enhancement

Enhancement is the most balanced category, allowing users to spread themselves evenly between offense and defense and become very powerful using only simple abilities. Examples of more complex Enhancement abilities include enhancing one's healing factor or boosting the target's growth. However, it is a common belief that Enhancers generally do not need special techniques as their natural category already has the best balance between attack and defense as its primary attribute.This might play into why most Enhancement Nen abilities in the series appear to be mere applications of basic and/or advanced Nen techniques at first glance due to the lack of requirement to manage between pros and cons on an overall scale during their development. Affinity for this category, in fact, plays a crucial role in combat at all times, even when a Nen ability is not being used.
