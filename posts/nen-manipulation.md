## Manipulation

Manipulators are the Nen users who can pour the most aura into an object, and they often rely on a medium which they have been utilizing for years. In many cases they are seen capable of inflicting and maintaining the effects of their abilities from afar, seemingly without the aid of Emission-type Nen, most commonly with the aid of a specific medium. The complexity of the orders assigned also depends on the target: sentient beings and machinery can carry out more complex tasks, as opposed to simpler, inanimate objects. Manipulation of the highest class is capable of semi-forcing the Aura Nodes of a non-user to open.

The main advantage of this category in combat is the ability to manipulate the enemy themselves. Abilities of this type are especially feared since the fight can be brought to an end as soon as the conditions are met. The aura of the ability user mixes with the target's, although it is not normally noticeable. The degree of control is, for the most part, determined by a condition that may or may not put the Manipulator at risk or at a disadvantage (such as attaching objects on the enemy, touching the enemy in a certain way): the higher the difficulty for the condition to be achieved, the better the degree of control. However, it is impossible to control a target that is already under the effect of Manipulation Nen.
